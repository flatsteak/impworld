# impworld

A port of [Northeastern's impworld](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510sp16/image-doc.html) library to Typescript and HTML (via canvas).

Currently this follows the impworld paradigm of modifying the world scene, but given that the code is so similar, it's likely funworld (an immutable abstraction) would be best just as an alternate class in this project.
